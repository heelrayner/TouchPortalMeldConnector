# Touch Portal Meld Connector

This repository contains the source for the **Meld Studio Control** Touch Portal plugin. The plugin exposes the Meld Studio API (via Qt WebChannel/JSON-RPC or the official CLI) to Touch Portal actions, states and events, enabling full remote automation.

The plugin itself lives in the `MeldTP/` folder and is ready to be packaged as a `.tpp` archive alongside the `entry.tp` manifest. See `MeldTP/README.md` for setup, packaging instructions and a detailed capability matrix.
